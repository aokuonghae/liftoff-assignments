### Overview
The grocery list tracker allows users to create a baseline grocery list that is caterered towards their particular household. It will have items that are

if not at home to physically check.  
### Features

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to add a way to keep track of the date when a grocery list is generated for use
when shopping and save that for view later. It is different than simply accessing the grocery list. Becaise I want
this to be used while actively shopping, I will need to make it mobile device friendly.
